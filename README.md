# Penguin CSS Animation

This project is a fun and creative representation of a penguin using HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the penguin animation using HTML.
- `styel.css`: The CSS file for styling the penguin and adding details like colors, shapes, and positions.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure that the `styel.css` file is in the same directory as `index.html`.
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the penguin animation.

## File Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)

The structure of the penguin is created using `<div>` elements, with each part (e.g., eyes, cheeks, hands) having a dedicated class. The `<link>` tag connects the `styel.css` file for styling.

### CSS (`styel.css`)

The CSS file contains the following:
- Styling for the penguin's body parts (head, eyes, hands, feet, etc.).
- Custom properties for positioning and colors.
- Optional animations (if applicable).

## Customization

Feel free to adjust the CSS to:
- Change the colors or shapes of the penguin.
- Add animations for interactivity.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of what the penguin looks like when rendered in the browser:

## Notes

- Double-check the CSS file link in `index.html` to ensure there are no typos (e.g., `styel.css` should be corrected to `style.css` if needed).
- This project is a simple static webpage and does not require any dependencies.
